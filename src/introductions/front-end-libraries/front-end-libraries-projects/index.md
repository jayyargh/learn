## Introduction to the Front End Libraries Projects

Exercise everything you have learned within the Front End Libraries section by completing the 5 projects listed below under __Upcoming Lessons__. You are encouraged to utilize any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete each project. For the projects you will be presented with a list of user stories that will indicate the requirements to consider each project as passing. You may read more about user stories on the FCC wiki found [here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/agile/user-stories/).

Improve this intro on [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/learn/blob/master/src/introductions/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/index.md).
